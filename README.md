#Enzyme-Constrained Metabolic Model of Treponema pallidum
This repository contains the code, models, and data files for the study titled "Enzyme-Constrained Metabolic Model of Treponema pallidum Identifies Glycerol-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase as an Alternate Electron Sink" by Nabia Shahreen, Niaz Bahar Chowdhury, Edward Stone, Elle Knobbe, and Rajib Saha. The study introduces the first genome-scale metabolic model (GEM) for T. pallidum (iTP251) and its enzyme-constrained counterpart (ec-iTP251), providing critical insights into the bacterium's unique metabolic adaptations.
